# Daily-Tech-News
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>
  This is a simple python script that uses tweepy and praw to interact with the twitter and reddit API's respectively. It takes the top post of today off the following subreddits, depending on which post is most popular:
  <ul>
    <li>r/technews</li>
    <li>r/apple</li>
    <li>r/technology</li>
  </ul>   
  The bot will tweet out the title of the post and the associated article link. It will also find 5 keywords in the article to use as hashtags within the tweet. It will post everyday at 9AM EST.
