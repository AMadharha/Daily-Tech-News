## Project Description
This is a simple python script that uses tweepy and praw to interact with the twitter and reddit API's respectively. It takes the top post of today off [r/technology](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/).

If the bot has already tweeted out the article, or the reddit post does not contain a external link, then it will find a different post from top of today and post it.

The bot will tweet out the title of the post and the associated article link. It will also find 5 keywords in the article to use as hashtags within the tweet. It also has retweeting, replying, and liking functionality.

All in EST: \
Tweets: 12AM/PM, 3AM/PM, 6AM/PM, 9AM/PM \
