## Project Description
This is a simple python script that uses tweepy and praw to interact with the twitter and reddit API's respectively. It takes the top post of today off [r/technology](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/)

If the bot has already tweeted out the article, or the reddit post does not contain a external link, then it will find a different post from top of today and post it.

The bot will tweet out the title of the post and the associated article link. It will also find 5 keywords in the article to use as hashtags within the tweet. It will post everyday at the following times (EST):

- 9 AM
- 12 PM
- 3 PM
- 6 PM
- 9 PM
